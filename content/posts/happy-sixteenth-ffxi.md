It's the 16th anniversary of Final Fantasy XI Online coming out.

FFXI was a huge part of my life for many years. I was addicted to that game in how people joke about MMO addicts being like. I still get the itch from time to time. I absolutely loved exploring that game and just hanging out.

The beginning of the end of my time playing the game was when my Link Shell leader who trained me in so much of playing White Mage in the game learned I wasn’t AFAB and kicked me from the Link Shell and blocked me, then did the same to my roommate for associating with me.

This was the first time something like this had happened, I had been spending 100% of my time online as a woman for years at this point but wasn’t really in a “trans” place. My roommate referred to me as a ‘he’ in Link Shell chat and it went south hard fast.

In the many years since then I’ve lost a few contacts online since they realized I’m not assigned female at birth but this is the one I’ll never forget because we used to be so close, talking every day.

It was about this time I realized one could transition but between this and watching my trans supervisor at ClientLogic being forced out of her job…

Well, I waited another 15-ish years to come out.

Today I Feel... excited/nervous. I really feel those those might be the exact same thing.
There is a lot of big things going on in my life from the transition, the dealing of my transition with my family and friends, the newnesss of it all, plus my trip to France, major projects at work, et. al.

It’s a lot going on in a little amount of time.

I signed up for the mastodons last night but I’m a bit concerned about it. I don’t need more social networks to browse and burn time ingesting random dopamine hits on. My hope is that mastodon will make a better outlet than other social media networks which have a larger mindshare and awareness. There is no business mastodon account yet. It’s just like every other social media system before it, new, fresh, and lower content. I’m not sure if it makes it any better or worse.

I picked a hilariously named server that I probably can’t share in the most polite company. This was semi-intentional. Maybe I can regret or shred this later but for now I’ll enjoy my account on girlcock.club.

I am excessively excited for the new projector bulb that came in today. I haven’t installed it yet as of this writing but I’m happy to get back to gaming and having my entertainment center back.

Wow. Dr. Rob knows how to hire. The guy who took my blood and the nurse practitioner I worked with were both amazing! So kind and nice. The guy that took my blood had me convinced me he was a seasoned pro and then after he jabbed me in one he mentioned his graduation ceremony is in January.

title: Today I Feel...

Today I Feel... anxiety about leaving the house. I feel more anxiety about how long I've felt anxious about leaving the house.

I've spent far more of my life being extroverted and open and loud. Now I'm going in this big circle where I'm having problems socializing and getting out.

I don't think it's just the trans-passing issues but also I've just had an extremely significant breakup and feel like some of my friendships are falling apart. There is more distance between a lot of friends and myself, and even more distance between me and my coworkers.

So much of this is driven by this internal awkwardness. Over the last several years over focused so much on self awareness and trying to improve that I've worked myself into this corner where I don't know how to do things "properly" or "correctly" anymore. I'm stepping on my toes trying not to step on toes.

There is also this hard to describe emotion where I feel like everything is so imposing and really want to spend so much more time with friends and family but it's hard to reach out, there is this veil and pushing through it is difficult.

Yesterday I spent all day rewriting some code from Python to Go. I got the entire program rewritten in a single day in a different language. I like Python and I like Go, but I wanted to see how the program looks and works in go. I ended up reusing a lot, but then refactoring to take a bit of a different style I found in some other go software online. The program doesn't really run all that faster, I was aware it was network bound since it runs thousands of api requests, but it did slice a few minutes off its normally ~40 minute job.

I wanted to brag about this. Or... tell people about it. I wanted to say something witty and fun to my trans-hacker friends like "current mode: transitioning code APAB, trans-go" or maybe just talk about the fact I did it to be social. But I was intimidated away from even talking about it because I know I'll have to defend all my code choices. "Ewww Python, why would you wrote things in Go? $LANG sucks and you suck for propagating it". I shouldn't feel that way. These people are my friends and should support and uplift me but I've watched them tear people down for less than choosing the wrong language.

It's getting to the point where I don't even know if I can call most people my friends anymore. It feels more like they are a group of people who tolerate my existence and I try not to annoy them too much. I like them but I don't know if they like, or are good for me.

My craft hasn't been going well. It's not bad but I'm not practicing as much as I would like to. I've been thinking a lot about my tarot deck and my altar. I need to do a big cleanse and reset myself and take on the worlds

Not having a TV for the past two weeks has been extremely annoying.

Not because I miss mindlessly droning entertainment I'll forget about in two weeks[^1] but because it was a focal point of the living room. Turning on the projector pinned myself, my roommate, and others to this central communal area. Without it there is less time spent in these communal areas and I really dislike that. My room is my office, my desk is my work space... I don't want to be in my room all alone. I suppose this goes back to Sonny other things.

[^1]: I was thinking about this Friday night while stoned and trying to fall asleep. I used to be actively worried about how much of my memory I "waisted" or used up filling myself with pop culture, media, trivia, and general trash. However that part of my memory system has responded by giving up trying to remember most media related events as important. I can hardly remember the name of the anime I watched last week, but I remember the feeling it gave me, and I suppose that's the important part, the fact I received and had the emotional response I wanted.

Many of my friends still actively reach out and work to talk to me, to hang out. I am so happy they do this but I feel bad at the same time. It's not like I am trying to ignore anyone or be distant. It's weird how I'm so busy yet not social enough for me or them. I need to spend more time out the house and being with than buckled in and reading or watching TV.

Today I have a lot to say I suppose! Funny how creativity comes and goes for me. One day I'll write 2k words of fiction and then two days later I can't put a line on paper... then it will be a while and BAM it all comes out.

Today I Feel... better after saying all this but I still probably won't leave the house. My date said they need to sleep in.

I miss having friends to drag out the house and that will drag me out more. They are becoming rarer sadly.

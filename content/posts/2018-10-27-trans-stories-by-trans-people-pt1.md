I picked up breakfast this morning. The waitress was this super kind personable type.

She came back with the card “Mr Aronsohn?“ and looked at everyone but me expectantly. She didn't hear me when I replied either. After asking twice I raised my hand and everyone pointed to me.

She was so mortified (hopefully by her mistake) that she made this amazingly shocked sound, handed the check folder over with this confused expression, and dashed away.

I've never even considered the fact that I've “passed” as a cis woman so that was kind of both an amazingly validating and completely humiliating moment.

This is the power a name has.

title: Today I feel...

I’ve entered the spiral of being anxiety ridden and depressed but when I talk about it I have a difficult time explaining why and that makes it worse because I feel I can’t justify it and so then I get anxiety about that and then I try to explain the fact I can’t explain…

I just want head-pats and acknowledgments.

I’ve hit this point where I fundamentally don’t feel validated anymore by most of those around me. It’s not like I’m surrounded by people who hate me or aren’t supportive. I just feel like I’m clawing at the walls and every time I open my mouth everyone is turning away from me. I’m trying to reach out and trying to have someone just acknowledge me without pandering and begging. I hardly even understand the why or the emotional meaning I’ve lost but I just want to be acknowledged.

Obviously there is a lot of people in my close inner circle who have gone above and beyond being supportive and kind and being for me all the time. I’m not trying to say that my friends aren’t there or don’t care… but… like… it’s just not enough? I don’t know.

I feel really broken and like I’m walking on eggshells in a world full of people who really don’t want to see me.

I don't have a _good reason_ to feel that way, but I have to learn to accept my feelings are valid if I want others to acknowledge my own feelings are valid I suppose.

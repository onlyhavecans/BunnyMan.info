I'm exceptionally upset and disturbed over the New York Times article[^1] about a memo looking to define trans people out of existence as a part of Title IX. 

[^1]: Instead of linking to the New York Times article because they don't need my link love go to [The Mary Sue](https://www.themarysue.com/trump-transgender-rights-attack/) where they talk about it if you need a refresher.

It's not the memo or the attempt to change Title IX that has me upset. (Here is where you link in 6mo when I need to eat my own words) I doubt the ability to get something like that passed and standing up in courts.

Considering the timing and the political climate this feels like an extremely conservative call to arms; a rallying cry to drive more of their voters out in response to the mobilization of the liberals. However that is what upsets me the most.

What has me flailing like Kermit T. Frog here is when stuff like this is published it emboldens bigots. It empowers them to do evil with great self righteousness.

They no longer to have to listen to all those voices about human rights, now they have a voice of hatred to focus on and galvanize around.

If you have enough mental fortitude go read the comments on the twitter or Facebook article of the NYT post, you will read floods and floods of people cheering with maga hat memes, grey people crying (this is a conservative meme of liberals), and even a few "gas them" memes (which is extra awesome to see).

They are cheering and rallying in "remembrance" that people in power support their bigotry and hatred and now "they are coming for us".

Fuck! How am I supposed to feel about that? It's horrible to be the person people are using as a hate point of rally. How am I supposed to function in society when these people are my neighbors, the people at my grocery shop, the people eating at the table next to me? It's hard enough to leave the house some times and now I have to think about who is feeling extra empowered today and decides to make a stand because I decided to buy groceries today?

Many of my friends know this pain, this anxiety; I'm not a unique nor exemplary target of hate. Nevertheless seeing the powers of this country stand up and shove their finger in my face specifically and say "fuck you go die in a corner" and then watching the unwashed masses cheer about it is horrible.

People wonder why trans people have this insanely high suicide rate; like it's some magic shock. Whaaat? It must be the hormones they take. It can't possibly be that everywhere I go I have people giving me dirty looks for being the person I want to be. Every moment I am outside of my house I have to wonder if the next person who's staring me daggers wants to make a scene and it's exhausting. 

In summary I'm hardly upset about the memo or the article. I'm upset about the galvanization of people who hate me for living my life.

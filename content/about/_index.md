title: Because life is too awesome not to share
---

This is a collection of personal writings from 2012 forward.

I don't expect to post regularly and you can expect a mix of quick tech tips, musings on my life, and feelings.

I hope it will be useful to you as a reader but I mostly treat this as an outlet for myself.

If you want to see more of my code I recommend you check out my personal gitea instance [OnlyHaveCans.Works](https://onlyhavecans.works)
